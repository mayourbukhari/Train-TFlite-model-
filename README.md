TensorFlow Lite is a lightweight framework for deploying deep learning models on edge devices with limited resources. It is optimized for faster inference time and requires less processing power, making it ideal for real-time applications.

## Getting Started

In this guide, you will learn how to train a custom TensorFlow Object Detection model, convert it into a TensorFlow Lite format, and run it on edge devices like Raspberry Pi, Android phones, and others. The guide also includes Python code for running TensorFlow Lite models for object detection on images, videos, web streams, or webcam feeds.

## Steps

### Step 1: Training TensorFlow Lite Models

The easiest way to train and convert a TensorFlow Lite model is using Google Colab. Google Colab provides a free GPU-enabled virtual machine with the necessary libraries and packages pre-installed. A Google Colab notebook is available that guides you through the process.

### Step 2: Setting Up the TensorFlow Lite Runtime Environment

Once you have trained a TFLite model, deploy it on your device. Guides are available for Raspberry Pi, Windows, and other devices. Install the TensorFlow or TensorFlow Lite Runtime on your device, set up the Python environment, and create the directory structure to run the application.

### Step 3: Running TensorFlow Lite Models

The guide provides Python scripts to run TensorFlow Lite object detection models on images, videos, web streams, or webcam feeds. Instructions are provided on how to run the scripts.

A sample TFLite object detection model is provided by Google. Download, unzip, and rename it to TFLite_model. Then, use the `--modeldir=coco_ssd_mobilenet_v1_1.0_quant_2018_06_29` option when running the script.

Options and more information on running the scripts are available by using the `-h` option when calling them. Check the FAQ section of the guide for common errors and solutions.


## FAQs

FAQs are included in the guide, discussing differences between the TensorFlow Object Detection API and TFLite Model Maker, as well as the differences between training, transfer learning, and fine-tuning.
