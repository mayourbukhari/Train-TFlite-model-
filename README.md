Introduction
TensorFlow Lite is a lightweight framework for deploying deep learning models on edge devices with limited resources. It is optimized for faster inference time and requires less processing power, making it ideal for real-time applications.

In this guide, you will learn how to train a custom TensorFlow Object Detection model, convert it into a TensorFlow Lite format, and run it on edge devices like Raspberry Pi, Android phones, and others. The guide also includes Python code for running TensorFlow Lite models for object detection on images, videos, web streams, or webcam feeds.

Step 1. Training TensorFlow Lite Models
The easiest way to train and convert a TensorFlow Lite model is using Google Colab. Google Colab provides a free GPU-enabled virtual machine with the necessary libraries and packages pre-installed. A Google Colab notebook is available that guides you through the process of preparing data, configuring a model, training the model, testing it, and exporting it in TFLite format.

Step 2. Setting Up the TensorFlow Lite Runtime Environment on Your Device
Once you have trained a TFLite model, the next step is to deploy it on your device. You will need to install the TensorFlow or TensorFlow Lite Runtime on your device, set up the Python environment, and create the directory structure to run the application. Guides are available for Raspberry Pi, Windows, and other devices.

Step 3. Running TensorFlow Lite Models
The guide provides four Python scripts to run TensorFlow Lite object detection models on an image, video, web stream, or webcam feed. The scripts are based on the TensorFlow Lite example "label_image.py." Instructions are provided on how to run the scripts.

A sample TFLite object detection model is also provided by Google that you can use. The model can be downloaded, unzipped, and renamed to TFLite_model. Then, you can use the "--modeldir=coco_ssd_mobilenet_v1_1.0_quant_2018_06_29" option when running the script.

Options and more information on running the scripts are available by using the "-h" option when calling them. If you encounter errors, check the FAQ section of the guide for common errors and solutions.

Examples of using the TFLite model for basic vision applications can be found in the examples folder.

FAQs are also included in the guide, discussing differences between the TensorFlow Object Detection API and TFLite Model Maker, as well as the differences between training, transfer learning, and fine-tuning.
